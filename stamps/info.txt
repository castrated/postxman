Stamping Rules:

Stamps are to be printed off on adhesive-backed paper, 
and stuck to the proper fields on request forms. They
can help identify sources, as well as what the sender
would like to do with the request. All request forms
must have a stamp on it, otherwise they will be
considered null requests.
